I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, even though the classes were defined in my `tailwind.config.js` file and I was importing the CSS file correctly.  The issue seemed to be that the class names were not being interpreted by the browser as Tailwind classes, therefore not applying the styles.
