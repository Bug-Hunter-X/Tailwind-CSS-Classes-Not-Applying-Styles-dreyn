The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Tailwind CSS build process was correctly configured and that the CSS file was correctly imported into my project. This usually involves using a tool like Webpack or Parcel to build your Tailwind styles. Make sure the `tailwind.config.js` is correctly configured, and the `purge` or `content` option is properly setup to scan all of your templates. Additionally, ensure that the `@tailwind` directives are present in your main CSS file.  A working setup would look something like this in your main CSS file: `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`
